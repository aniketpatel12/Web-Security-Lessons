The following are some examples of high-level techniques and tools that you can use to help identify information disclosure vulnerabilities during testing.

1. Fuzzing:

-> try to find any interresting input parameter
-> input random data (diff data types/try to enter unique data/craffted fuzzing strings)
-> You can automate much of this process using tools such as Burp Intruder. This provides several benefits. Most notably, you can:

    >> Add payload positions to parameters and use pre-built wordlists of fuzz strings to test a high volume of different inputs in quick succession.
    >> Easily identify differences in responses by comparing HTTP status codes, response times, lengths, and so on.
    >> Use grep matching rules to quickly identify occurrences of keywords, such as error, invalid, SELECT, SQL, and so on.
    >> Apply grep extraction rules to extract and compare the content of interesting items within responses.

2. Using Burp Scanner

-> Using Burp's engagement tools:  Burp provides several engagement tools that you can use to find interesting information in the target website more easily. 
   You can access the engagement tools from the context menu - just right-click on any HTTP message, Burp Proxy entry, or item in the site map and go to "Engagement tools".

Some of the places where you can find some information...

1. Check source-code, may be in the comment you can find somemthing interesting information/framework name/any hidden direcotory/
2. Try to give different input then expected...and then check the error (Sometimees in the error you found vulnerable framework/SQL hint/any other info.)
   (You might also discover that the website is using some kind of open-source framework. In this case, you can study the publicly available source code, which is an invaluable resource for constructing your own exploits)
   
3. Debugging data (Try to find out the debug page and try to get the acess so that you can find the session related info/secret_key)
